<h1>Statistical Inference</h1>

<h2>1. Need for Sampling</h2>
<p>
In many real-life situations, studying the entire population is either impossible or impractical due to limitations
such as time, cost, and accessibility. Sampling provides an effective alternative by allowing conclusions about
the population to be drawn using a smaller, manageable subset of data.
</p>
<p>
A properly chosen sample can accurately represent the characteristics of the population. Sampling is widely
used in engineering, quality control, social sciences, and data analysis to make reliable decisions with limited
resources.
</p>

<h2>2. Sampling Methods</h2>
<p>
Sampling techniques determine how units are selected from a population. The choice of method affects the
accuracy and reliability of results.
</p>

<p><b>Simple Random Sampling With Replacement (SRSWR):</b></p>
<p>
In SRSWR, each unit selected is returned to the population before the next draw. As a result, the same unit may
appear multiple times in the sample. Each draw is independent and has equal probability.
</p>

<p><b>Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR):</b></p>
<p>
In SRSWOR, once a unit is selected, it is not returned to the population. This ensures that all observations in
the sample are distinct and dependent on previous selections.
</p>

<h2>3. Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>
Hypothesis testing is a formal statistical procedure used to make decisions about population parameters based
on sample information. It involves testing an assumption (hypothesis) to determine whether it is supported by
the data.
</p>
<p>
Two hypotheses are formulated: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Statistical evidence from the
sample is used to decide whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.
</p>

<h3>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
<p>
The null hypothesis (H₀) represents a statement of no change or no difference. The alternative hypothesis (H₁)
represents the presence of a difference or effect.
</p>

<div class="formula">
H₀ : μ = μ₀ <br>
H₁ : μ ≠ μ₀ (Two-tailed) <br>
H₁ : μ &gt; μ₀ (Right-tailed) <br>
H₁ : μ &lt; μ₀ (Left-tailed)
</div>

<h2>4. Z-Test</h2>
<p>
A Z-test is used for testing hypotheses about population means or proportions when the sample size is large
or when the population standard deviation is known. It relies on the standard normal distribution.
</p>

<h3>Conditions for Using Z-Test</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sample size n ≥ 30</li>
<li>Population standard deviation σ is known</li>
<li>Population is approximately normal</li>
<li>Observations are independent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Z-Test Statistic</h3>
<p>
The Z-statistic measures how far the sample mean deviates from the hypothesized population mean in terms of
standard error.
</p>

<div class="formula">
Z = ( x̄ − μ₀ ) / ( σ / √n )
</div>

<h3>Decision Rule</h3>
<p>
The calculated Z-value is compared with the critical value obtained from the standard normal distribution table
to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Two-tailed test: Reject H₀ if |Z| &gt; 1.96</li>
<li>Right-tailed test: Reject H₀ if Z &gt; 1.645</li>
<li>Left-tailed test: Reject H₀ if Z &lt; −1.645</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Confidence Intervals</h2>
<p>
A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie
with a specified level of confidence. It reflects both accuracy and reliability of estimation.
</p>

<div class="formula">
Confidence Interval = Point Estimate ± Margin of Error
</div>

<h3>Confidence Interval for Mean (σ Known)</h3>
<p>
When the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, the Z-distribution is used to
construct the confidence interval.
</p>

<div class="formula">
x̄ ± zα/2 (σ / √n)
</div>

<h3>Confidence Interval for Mean (σ Unknown)</h3>
<p>
If the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, the t-distribution is used with
(n − 1) degrees of freedom.
</p>

<div class="formula">
x̄ ± tα/2 (s / √n)
</div>

<h3>Confidence Interval for Population Proportion</h3>
<p>
Confidence intervals for proportions are used to estimate the fraction of the population possessing a certain
characteristic.
</p>

<div class="formula">
p̂ ± zα/2 √[ (p̂q̂) / n ]
</div>

<h2>6. Tests for Mean</h2>
<p>
Tests for mean help determine whether a sample mean significantly differs from a hypothesized population mean.
</p>

<h3>Single Population (σ Known)</h3>
<div class="formula">
Z = (x̄ − μ₀) / (σ / √n)
</div>

<h3>Single Population (σ Unknown)</h3>
<div class="formula">
t = (x̄ − μ₀) / (s / √n)
</div>

<h2>7. Tests for Difference of Means</h2>
<p>
These tests are used to compare the means of two independent populations to determine whether a significant
difference exists.
</p>

<h3>Population SD Known</h3>
<div class="formula">
Z = (x̄₁ − x̄₂) / √(σ₁²/n₁ + σ₂²/n₂)
</div>

<h3>Population SD Unknown (Pooled t-test)</h3>
<div class="formula">
sp² = [(n₁−1)s₁² + (n₂−1)s₂²] / (n₁ + n₂ − 2)
</div>

<div class="formula">
t = (x̄₁ − x̄₂) / [sp √(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]
</div>

<h2>8. Tests for Proportion</h2>
<p>
Proportion tests are used to analyze categorical data and determine whether observed proportions differ
significantly from assumed values.
</p>

<h3>Single Population</h3>
<div class="formula">
Z = (p̂ − p₀) / √(p₀q₀ / n)
</div>

<h3>Difference of Two Proportions</h3>
<div class="formula">
p = (x₁ + x₂) / (n₁ + n₂)
</div>

<div class="formula">
Z = (p₁ − p₂) / √[pq(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]
</div>
